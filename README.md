# DailyDoc
**Productivity Note App utilizing Jetpack Compose**

***Working with another developer to build mocks to rebuild the design for Daily Doc! Current design only showcases current app functionality***


First project - Feedback welcomed! 

Daily Doc is a productivity app to help you keep track of your daily progress inspired by 100-day-challenges.

--------------------------------------
  
Server connects to my Ktor server & MongoDb, so will not function properly if you do not set it up.

Install the Ktor server at [Ktor Daily Doc Server](https://github.com/B-Lidberg/ktor-daily-doc)

Google Login is currently disabled. Also, since the server only works locally, I have not added
encryption.

Discussion open - feel free to communicate through it as well if you're interested in a feature you would like for me to implement!
