Note App utilizing Jetpack Compose


First project - Feedback welcomed! 

Currently a simple note taking app that stores notes locally. 

Few features I'll be adding:
- Login Screen
- Remote Database
- Profile Settings
- Limit 1 note per day (can be edited on same day but restricted editing after)
- Improved UI
- Animations
- Remove "Clear All" Button. Currently there
- Search features: Date, text in Summary/Body, by survey answers
