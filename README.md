# DailyDoc
**Productivity Note App utilizing Jetpack Compose**

***
Currently working on improving UI features and will be applying these directly to the main branch***


First project - Feedback welcomed!

There is a branch without Hilt (pre-hilt) if you're interested, but it will no longer be updated unless asked to.

There is also branches for local Database only, and another with remote using Retrofit & Proto DataStore. 
I may update the remote database, but the local only will remain.


Discussion open - feel free to communicate through it as well if you're interested in a feature you would like for me to implement!

**Other Recent Features Added**

Server connects to my Ktor Server, so will not function properly if you do not set it up.
Install the code at [Ktor Daily Doc Server](https://github.com/B-Lidberg/ktor-daily-doc)
Google Login is currently disabled. Also, since the server only works locally, I have not added
encryption.
